> **Note:** To ensure that the runbook is running on a fixed schedule I would recommend creating a schedule that runs at least once a day and publishes new application versions. There should be a minimum time of 1h between runbook executions as the Enterprise Application Management report in Intune requires some time to recognize, that a new application version has been published.
